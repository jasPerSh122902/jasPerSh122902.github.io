            <p><a class="paragraph_Text">This game was made with the combined power of 3 artists and 3 programmers. I was a programmer and I made the start and restart menu, shooting of the gun, and the land moving.</a></p>

            <p><img class="portrait" src="/assets/img/YokaiStartMenu1.0.gif"/></p>
            <p><a class="paragraph_Text">There are two buttons, the top is to start and bottom to leave. Then I put an image backdrop.</a></p>
           
            <h3><a class="header">Restart UI</a></h3>
            <p><img class="portrait" src="/assets/img/YokaiRestartMenu1.0.gif"/></p>

            <h3><a class="header">Shooting</a></h3>
            <p><img class="portrait" src="/assets/img/YokaiShooting1.0.gif"/></p>
            <p><a class="paragraph_Text">Shooting is one of the main forms of damage. When you touch the main fire bullet(left click/right lower bumper) you can shoot. The Bullet that is fired will travel down the lane and will only despawn when it hits something.</a></p>
           
            <h3><a class="header">Moving</a></h3>
            <p><img class="portrait" src="/assets/img/YokaiMoving1.0.gif"/></p>
            <p><a class="paragraph_Text">Movement in Yokai invasion is only moving to preplaced boxes which are the sides of the player. When moving one of my concerns was where and how could the player move. Then I got a push in a direction from a group member so I made the player only move from side to side. By doing this I was able to set boxes to allow the player to move and stop them from going out of the area. </a></p>

            <h3><a class="header">GameManager</a></h3>
            <p><a class="paragraph_Text">I made a game manager to make wave spawning and the transition of the area a lot easier. The manager is a switch statement that controls all active game events.</a></p>

            <h3><a class="header">WaveSpawning</a></h3>
            <p><img class="portrait" src="/assets/img/YokaiSpawning1.0.gif"/></p>
            <p><a class="paragraph_Text">When all enemies are dead the spawners in the scene will activate and spawn enemies based on the wave amount. The enemies that are spawned are all random and have no pattern.</a></p>

            <h3><a class="header">AreaMoveing</a></h3>
            <p><img class="portrait" src="/assets/img/YokaiLevelMoving1.0.gif"/></p>
            <p><a class="paragraph_Text">The area moves after each wave is spawned. At first, I wanted only the path to be moving but after a plethora of tests, I decided to move the whole map.</a></p>
